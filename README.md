- Analyzes browsing frequency and patterns to detect signs of digital fatigue.
- Identifies prolonged exposure to negative content and sends alerts.

### **3. Mindfulness Recommendations**
- Based on stress levels, the extension suggests:
  - Breathing exercises
  - Meditation sessions
  - Guided affirmations
  - Break reminders

### **4. User Insights Dashboard**
- Users can log in to a web-based dashboard to:
  - View browsing behavior trends
  - Track their digital well-being score
  - Adjust settings for personalized recommendations

### **5. Privacy and Security**
- No personal data is stored or shared.
- Data processing is done locally within the browser to maintain user privacy.
- Users can customize the level of monitoring and disable tracking at any time.
